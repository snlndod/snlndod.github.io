<h3 id="USEFUL-TIPS"><a href="#USEFUL-TIPS" class="headerlink" title="USEFUL TIPS"></a>USEFUL TIPS</h3><ul>
<li>Successful small talk is not about saying brilliant things. It’s about commenting on and asking about <strong>ordinary things</strong> with conviction, interest, and enthusiasm;</li>
<li><strong>Match the mood</strong> of your conversation partner. If they are smiling and cheerful, be ready to laugh. If they seem serious, be serious too;</li>
<li>Ask where your partner comes from and, when somebody asks you the same thing, be ready to add <strong>something interesting</strong> about the place;</li>
<li>Ask what your partner does and, when you’re asked the same question, <strong>don’t only give a title</strong>. Add a small piece of interesting or amusing information about the job or responsibility;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Track-01"><a href="#Track-01" class="headerlink" title="Track 01"></a>Track 01</h3><h4 id="1"><a href="#1" class="headerlink" title="1"></a>1</h4><p>A: That was really interesting what the last speaker said about opening bank accounts in the Cayman Islands.<br>B: Yes, it was. <strong>So, what do you do exactly?</strong><br>A: <strong>I’m an auditor, a forensic auditor.</strong><br>B: Ah, um, you’re a forensic, um, auditor?<br>A: Yes, that’s right.<br>B: Right, oh. I see. Look at the time! I must get to the next presentation…</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<h4 id="2"><a href="#2" class="headerlink" title="2"></a>2</h4><p>C: Mmm, lovely coffee! I needed that. I just flew in from London very early this morning. <strong>How did you get here?</strong><br>D: I came on the TGV train from Paris.<br>C: Really? I’ve never been on the TGV. <strong>How long did that take?</strong><br>D: Oh, about 4 hours. But I was able to have breakfast and do some reading.<br>C: That sounds nice. I must try it sometime. <strong>Marseilles’s really beautiful, isn’t it?</strong><br>D: Yes, it is. <strong>Have you been here before?</strong> If you haven’t, you must…</p>
<h4 id="3"><a href="#3" class="headerlink" title="3"></a>3</h4><p>E: …I’m certainly looking forward to the dinner this evening.<br>F: I am too. Especially the fish. We don’t have much fish where I live.<br>E: Really? <strong>Where do you come from then?</strong><br>F: Garmisch-Partenkirchen. It’s in the mountains just near Munich. What about you?<br>E: I’m from Cork in Ireland. The high street is supposed to have more pubs than any other town in Ireland.<br>F: Really? I’m going there on a business trip soon to visit the Apple factory. I must see if I can find time to visit some…</p>
<h4 id="4"><a href="#4" class="headerlink" title="4"></a>4</h4><p>G: …and then I went jogging early this morning along by the sea. Fantastic sunrise coming up over the sea.<br>H: Really? Sunrise, you say?<br>G: Yes, amazing! Do you like jogging? You should try it, you know. It makes you feel really great all day long. Just set the alarm for 5:30, jump out of bed and after you’ve been running for about an hour or so, go back, have a shower and…<br>H: <strong>Sorry, but do you know where I can smoke?</strong> I think I want a cigarette before the next presentation. Ah, that way? Thanks.</p>

<p>It’s a very challenging profession.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="USEFUL-TIPS-1"><a href="#USEFUL-TIPS-1" class="headerlink" title="USEFUL TIPS"></a>USEFUL TIPS</h3><p>When telling people about your job:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be brief</strong> and precise;</li>
<li>Show how your job <strong>benefits people</strong> or organizations;</li>
<li>Make sure that your description is <strong>relevant to the person</strong> you are talking to;</li>
<li><strong>Avoid technical terms</strong> or abbreviations unless talking to a fellow expert;</li>
<li><strong>Emphasize the positive aspects</strong> rather than the negative;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Track-07"><a href="#Track-07" class="headerlink" title="Track 07"></a>Track 07</h3><p>Student: Excuse me, are you working on the Foodaid stand?<br>Jenny: Yes, can I help you?<br>S: Well, can you tell me what jobs at Foodaid involve?<br>J: There are lots of jobs at Foodaid which <strong>involve doing</strong> all sorts of different things. What subject do you study at university?<br>S: Engineering<br>J: Very important for Foodaid. My colleague, Hassan Sahin, for example, is a mechanical engineer and <strong>he is responsible for helping</strong> farmers in countries such as Chad or Pakistan where we work as an NGO to drill water wells.<br>S: Er… an NGO?<br>J: Sorry, a Non-Governmental Organization.<br>S: Right, of course. And what do you do?<br>J: Well, actually <strong>I’m a lawyer. I’m in charge of managing</strong> the legal department and we make sure that Foodaid understands any legal issues that might crop up in the work it does.<br>S: I hope I don’t sound rude, but you look very young to do that.<br>J: That’s what’s so good about Foodaid! You get important responsibilities very quickly. A friend of mine is working in Somalia and <strong>she manages</strong> a development budget of about 2 million dollars and <strong>she supplies</strong> the whole of West Africa with trucks for transporting food and equipment. <strong>It’s a very challenging job</strong> and she’s only 23!<br>S: I see. But, as it’s a charity, do you get paid for your work?<br>J: Yes, of course. You’ll never be rich working for Foodaid, but you get paid. Very often people like you work with us for a few years to gain experience and then they move on to other jobs. Lots of companies like the fact that you’ve worked for a charity.<br>S: Hmm. So, what makes a job with Foodaid interesting, then?<br>J: <strong>It’s very rewarding.</strong> You feel you are doing something useful with your skills, not just making some company shareholders rich. And even if <strong>the work is demanding</strong>, it’s never boring.<br>S: It sounds really interesting. Thanks for telling me about it.<br>J: That’s fine. Here’s some more information about what we do and my card. If you have any more questions, just give me a ring…</p>

<p>Oh, I know what you mean.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="USEFUL-TIPS-2"><a href="#USEFUL-TIPS-2" class="headerlink" title="USEFUL TIPS"></a>USEFUL TIPS</h3><p>When you are in conversation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Echo the key information</strong> to encourage further explanation, for example, <em>I’m allergic to shellfish. To shellfish?</em>;</li>
<li>Empathize. Use phrases to show that you <strong>understand how your partner feels</strong>, for example, <em>That’s amazing!</em> or <em>Really?</em>;</li>
<li>Paraphrase. <strong>Reformulate in your own words</strong> what has been said to show that you are listening, for example, <em>So what you’re telling me is…</em>;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Track-10"><a href="#Track-10" class="headerlink" title="Track 10"></a>Track 10</h3><p>Casper: It’s very different way to do business here in Singapore, compared to Germany.<br>Emily: <strong>I know what you mean.</strong> Do you find it difficult?<br>C: No, not at all. It’s interesting.<br>E: Interesting?<br>C: Yes. For example, in Singapore you discuss prices much earlier in a negotiation than we do in Germany.<br>E: <strong>Really? So, you mean that</strong> you leave price negotiations till the end of a discussion?<br>C: Oh, yes. In Singapore you start talking about prices for products when in Germany we’re still trying to define exactly what’s wanted.<br>E: <strong>How amazing!</strong> I didn’t realize. I suppose we think it’s a waste of time discussing something if the price is always going to be unrealistic.<br>C: <strong>I see.</strong><br>E: Whereas in Germany you feel you can’t begin to think about price until you know all the details.<br>C: <strong>That’s right.</strong><br>E: So, do you like Singapore?<br>C: Oh, yes. Very much, especially the food. But I need to do some sport. I’ve put on 2 kilos already! Back in Berlin I play centre forward for the company football team.<br>E: <strong>Really?</strong><br>C: Yes, um… anyway, um…<br>E: Do you notice any other differences between business life here and in Germany?<br>C: Well, another difference is the flexibility that a manager has here.<br>D: Flexibility?<br>C: Yes. In Germany it’s very difficult to be a manager because every time you want to introduce a change in the organization or in communication processes, you have to ask the Workers’ Council for permission. This makes innovation very slow, which isn’t good for the employees at all.<br>E: <strong>So, what you’re saying is</strong> that the Workers’ Council in Germany makes things more difficult for employees, not easier.<br>C: Sometimes, yes.<br>E: <strong>That’s terrible!</strong></p>
<h2 id="Exchanging-information"><a href="#Exchanging-information" class="headerlink" title="Exchanging information"></a>Exchanging information</h2><blockquote>
<p>I heard it on the grapevine.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="USEFUL-TIPS-3"><a href="#USEFUL-TIPS-3" class="headerlink" title="USEFUL TIPS"></a>USEFUL TIPS</h3><p>Here are 3 ways to get the information you want within your organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First offer appropriate information</strong> yourself. If you want to find out about a particular area, offer information of your own first to show you can be trusted. Think carefully about what information is appropriate to pass on to others;</li>
<li><strong>Ask questions indirectly.</strong> If you want to ask about sb or sth, use statements with question tags rather than direct questions, for example, <em>You know John, don’t you?</em> rather than <em>Do you know John?</em> A direct question may frighten someone into remaining silent but a statement that sounds more like speculation will often be confirmed or corrected by sb with better information;</li>
<li><strong>Create intimacy.</strong> If you don’t know sb very well, but want to exchange information with that person, you can use these techniques: Drop their name into conversation more than usual and use <em>we, us</em> and <em>our</em> as often as possible, for example, <em>I think we’re going to see a lot of changes in our department soon, Peter.</em>;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Track-18"><a href="#Track-18" class="headerlink" title="Track 18"></a>Track 18</h3><p>Candy: I really want to thank you, Michael, for taking me with you to the meeting. I just can’t get used to driving on the left!<br>Michael: No problem.<br>C: You used to work for our new chief legal officer, Christine Bender, didn’t you?<br>M: Yes, that’s right. She and I started together in the legal department 5 years ago. Then I changed over to IT.<br>C: Christine is so successful. She did an amazing job for us dealing with that whole corruption scandal last year, don’t you think?<br>M: Yes, she did. But, <strong>between you and me,</strong> Christine could never have managed that without her team.<br>C: That’s so true, Michael. She always picks good people to work with her. By the way, <strong>I heard on the grapevine</strong> that she’s going to move to our New York office next.<br>M: Yes, I heard that too. <strong>I wonder how</strong> her husband feels about it. He’s journalist, I think.<br>C: Well, <strong>according to</strong> Christine’s assistant, Mrs Weber, that’s not a problem. He’s going to write articles about New York nightlife. Although <strong>I can’t imagine</strong> who’s going to look after the children then.<br>M: <strong>Apparently,</strong> they’re going to have a nanny. <strong>I overheard</strong> Christine talking to the boss about it this morning. It must be very expensive, but they’ll have enough money.<br>C: <strong>I suppose</strong> they might appoint sb from Christine’s team to carry on her work.<br>M: Ah, no! <strong>It seems that</strong> Christine didn’t want to recommend any of them to the boss, so Gabriele from the commercial department will take over. Christine’s team was really angry!</p>
